## Description

A redev based on the [original link with three.js ver59 dev](https://mrdoob.com/lab/javascript/threejs/css3d/periodictable/).

also [here](https://threejs.org/examples/css3d_periodictable.html).

It was originally a project to exhibit the power of three.js, and got praised by people after released. Though it has fancy visual effect, its functions are limited to exhibiting purposes. In this repo I've extended some features on the original one, making it more than just a fancy periodic table.
